# Getting started


## Statement of need

`cifkit` distinguishes itself from existing libraries creating and manipulating .cif files by offering higher-level
functions and variables that enable users to perform complex tasks efficiently
with a few lines of code. `cifkit` not only facilitates the visualization of
coordination geometry from each site but also extracts physics-based features
like volume and packing efficiency, crucial for structural analysis in ML tasks.
Additionally, it extracts atomic mixing information at the bond pair levelâ€”tasks
that would otherwise require extensive manual effort using GUI-based tools like
VESTA, Diamond, and CrystalMaker, due to the lack of readily available
higher-level functions.

Further enhancing its utility, cifkit excels in sorting, preprocessing, and
understanding the distribution of underlying CIF files. Common issues in CIF
files from databases, such as incorrect loop values and missing fractional
coordinates, are systematically addressed as cifkit standardizes and filters out
ill-formatted files. It also preprocesses atomic site labels, transforming
labels such as 'M1' to 'Fe1' in files with atomic mixing. Beyond error
correction, cifkit provides functionalities to copy, move, and sort files based
on attributes like coordination numbers, space groups, unit cells, and shortest
distances. It also excels in visualizing and cataloging CIF files, organizing
them based on supercell size, tags, coordination numbers, elements, and atomic
mixing, among other parameters.

## Overview

Designed for individuals with minimal programming experience, `cifkit` provides
two primary objects: `Cif` and `CifEnsemble`.

### Cif

**`Cif`** is initialized with a `.cif` file path. It parses the `.cif` file,
generates supercells, and computes nearest neighbors. It also determines
coordination numbers using four different methods and generates polyhedrons for
each site.

### CifEnsemble

**`CifEnsemble`** is initialized with a folder path containing `.cif` files. It
identifies unique attributes, such as space groups and elements, across the
`.cif` files, moves and copies files based on these attributes. It generates
histograms for all attributes.
