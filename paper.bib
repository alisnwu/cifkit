	abstract = {We present the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) library, a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project’s REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen’s interface to the Materials Project’s RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li–Sn–S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.},

	abstract = {The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML), a subdiscipline of artificial intelligence studies, has gained importance in predicting or suggesting efficient thermoelectric materials. Previous ML studies have used different literature sources or density functional theory calculations as input. In this work, we develop a ML pipeline trained with multivariable inputs on a massive public dataset of ∼200,000 data utilizing a high-performance computing cluster to predict the thermal conductivity (κ) using four test sets: three publicly available datasets and a dataset built using previously published data from our own group. By taking advantage of this massive dataset, our model presents an opportunity to further expand the understanding of the selection of features with various thermoelectric materials. Among the several supervised ML models implemented, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost) turned out to be the best method during the 5-fold cross-validation method, with their averaged evaluation coefficients of R2 = 0.96, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.38 W m−1K−1, and mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.23 W m−1K−1. Additionally, with the aid of feature selection and importance analysis, useful chemical features were chosen that ultimately led to reasonably good accuracy in the series of test sets measured as per the evaluation coefficients of R2, RMSE, and MAE, with values ranging from 0.72 to 0.89, 0.52 to 1.08, and 0.40 to 0.66 W m−1K−1, respectively. Checking the worst outliers led to the discovery of some errors in the literature. Postmodel prediction, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm was implemented on the XGBoost model to analyze the features that were the key drivers for the model’s decisions. Overall, the developed interpretable methodology produces the prediction of κ of a large variety of materials through the influence of chemical and physical property features. The conclusions drawn apply to the research and applications of thermoelectric and heat insulation materials.},

The compounds belong to a large family of ternary rare-earth indides with intergrowth of the AlB2- and CsCl-type related slabs. In the Er23Co6.7In20.3 structure, four types of fragments REIn and RET of CsCl-type, as well as RET2 and REIn2 of AlB2-type, are present simultaneously.
