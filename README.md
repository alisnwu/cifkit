`cifkit` is designed to provide a set of fully-tested utility functions and
variables for handling large datasets, on the order of tens of thousands, of
`.cif` files.

> The current codebase and documentation are actively being improved as of Sep
> 18, 2024.

## What cifkit does

`cifkit` provides higher-level functions in just a few lines of code.

- **Coordination geometry** - `cifkit` provides fuctions for visualing
  coordination geometry from each site and extracts physics-based features like
  volume and packing efficiency in each polyhedron.
- **Atomic mixing** - `cifkit` extracts atomic mixing information at the bond
  pair levelâ€”tasks that would otherwise require extensive manual effort using
  GUI-based tools like VESTA, Diamond, and CrystalMaker.
- **Filter** - `cifkit` offers features for preprocessing. It systematically
  addresses common issues in CIF files from databases, such as incorrect loop
  values and missing fractional coordinates, by standardizing and filtering out
  ill-formatted files. It also preprocesses atomic site labels, transforming
  labels such as 'M1' to 'Fe1' in files with atomic mixing.
- **Sort** - `cifkit` allows you to copy, move, and sort `.cif` files based on
  attributes such as coordination numbers, space groups, unit cells, shortest
  distances, elements, and more.

### Example

You can visualize the polyhedron generated from each atomic site based on the
coordination number geometry.

```python
from cifkit import Cif

# Example usage
cif = Cif("your_cif_file_path")
site_labels = cif.site_labels

# Loop through each site
for label in site_labels:
    # Dipslay each polyhedron, a file saved for each
    cif.plot_polyhedron(label, is_displayed=True)
```
